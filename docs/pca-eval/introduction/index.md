## Introduction

PCA-EVAL is an innovative benchmark for evaluating multi-domain embodied decision-making, specifically focusing on the performance in perception, cognition, and action. It is proposed in paper "[Towards End-to-End Embodied Decision Making via Multi-modal Large Language Model: Explorations with GPT4-Vision and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02071)".
